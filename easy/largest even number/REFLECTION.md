## What went well

I got the solution fairly easily and the solution came to me in an aha moment. Once i fully read the description I realized that i can simply have an early check to see if the string ends in 2 and if so we can return it. Then I realized that we can loop backwards and as soon as we get a 2 we can return the rest of the string from 0 to i + 1

## What went wrong

I didnt read the entire description so I had some misconceptions and was overcomplicating it

## Closing Notes

I need to read the entire description before continuing not just the examples
