## What went well

After reading the description I had an idea of what to do immedietly

## What went wrong

As I have not touched python in a while I forgot how to use dict and list and how to create them with the nested for loops. So that took me a while to get. Then i didnt consider the edge case where a student has all teh same score (i was using a set) so this would mess it up. I initally used a set() to get O(1) lookup time but it backfired. The only other thing was that i was naively choosing the min value for a while but I figured it out after a couple of print statements

## Closing Notes

optimize later
