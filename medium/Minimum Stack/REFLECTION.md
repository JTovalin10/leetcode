# Overview

## Information

name: Min Stack
number: 155
ranking: N/A

## What went well

I got all functions to work on my first implementation and it had very goo memory usage and runtime.

## what went wrong

I got stuck for 5 minutes on how I wanted to implmenet this. I knew that I wanted to use 2 stacks--one for min and a general one. But I was blanking on how the min one would work. I eventually just thought that it would check if its last element is greater than the new pushed elemenet and if it is then we add the new elemenet to the top.

## reflection

Overall went very well
